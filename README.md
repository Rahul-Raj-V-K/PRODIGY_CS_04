# Simple Keylogger
A simple keylogger is a type of software designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer or mobile device. Often used for legitimate purposes such as parental control, employee monitoring, or IT security, it captures every keystroke made by the user and stores this data for review. While keyloggers can be used ethically, they also pose significant privacy risks if used maliciously, as they can capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages without the user's consent. It is important to be aware of the legal and ethical implications of deploying such software.
